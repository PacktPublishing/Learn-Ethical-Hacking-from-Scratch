The latest version of evilgrade does not work properly, so don't download evilgrade using the git clone command in the video, instead download it from the following link:



https://www.dropbox.com/s/vr1mpesah1ybuai/evilgrade.zip?dl=1

Then go to the downloads and boule click evilgrade.zip to uncompress it.



Now open a terminal and run the following commands:


cd /root/Downloads/evilgrade/
cpan Data::Dump
cpan Digest::MD5
cpan Time::HiRes
cpan RPC::XML
cp -r isrcore /etc/perl



Now the tool will work, it might display an error about Gnu.pm, 
this is a known bug with evil-grade, if its annoying you
 then you can get rid of it using the by removing that lib using
 the following command
:


apt-get remove libterm-readline-gnu-perl



Just make sure you re-install it after you're done in case it is
needed by other tools:




apt-get install libterm-readline-gnu-perl
